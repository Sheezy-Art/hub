Sheezy.Art is a community website focussed around up-and-coming artists of all ages. Members can share their work, meet new friends and collaborate in a safe, positive and engaging environment, and get their art noticed while they’re doing it. It’s free to join and is growing rapidly!

Sheezyart.com was one of the few major communities back in the early 2000's that brought up a whole generation of artists and animators, many of whom are now well-known as industry professionals and public figures.

When the site was shut down in 2013, terabytes of work was sadly lost. But even worse, the community disappeared - many users simply vanished from the internet and a gargantuan swathe of friendships simply fizzled into nothing.

That's why we have made it our mission to create a brand new experience in sheezy.art - publishing your creations to the world should be easy. It should be positive and encouraging, and there should be absolutely nothing standing in the way of a young or new artist who wants to express themselves and get noticed.
