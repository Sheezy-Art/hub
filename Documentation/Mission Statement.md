# Mission Statement

**Sheezy.Art** is a community website designed for up-and-coming independent artists of all ages to share their work, meet new friends and collaborate in a safe, positive and engaging environment - and get their work noticed while theyâ€™re doing it.

SheezyArt.com was one of the few major communities back in the early 2000's that raised a generation of artists and animators, many of whom are now well-known industry professionals and public figures. When it was shut down in 2013, vast swathes of work was lost forever - not to mention the community itself.

That's why we have made it our mission to create a brand new experience in **Sheezy.Art** - publishing your creations to the world should be _easy_. It should be _positive_ and _encouraging_, and there should be absolutely _nothing_ standing in the way of an independent artist who wants to express themselves and get noticed.
