Access Rights

Your access to and use of the site may be revoked at any time at the discretion of our administrative or moderation teams.

You must be at least 13 years old to access this site.

This website is not intended for use by, or targeted at agencies, large companies, corporations or large-scale brands. The site was built specifically to accomodate new and up-and-coming independent artists and individuals with an interest in creative media. Any accounts created by an agency, large company, corporation or large-scale brand, or created specifically for the purpose of advertising or marketing are in direct violation of these terms and conditions and will be removed.

Liability

This is a website running on a remote server using proprietary code. Thus, any damage sustained to you or the device(s) you use to access the site are not our responsiblity.

All copyrights, liabilities and responsibilties regarding any and all user generated content fall to the respective author of said user content, as stipulated in the footer section of each artwork or series' webpage. By uploading content to the site, you agree that we may display said content to other users of the site as well as to members of the public.

Regarding any text content uploaded to the site by registered users, the responsibilities herein lie again with the author of said content. If you choose to post sensitive or private information to the site, it is your responsibility to keep this information safe.

Any illegal content uploaded to the site will be removed, and a summary of said content and its author's email address will be sent to law enforcement. Providing someone else's sensitive information without their consent is also against these terms and will be treated as illegal material.

We reserve the right to remove any user submitted content from the site at any time for any reason.

The design, user interface and code used by the site are our own intellectual property, unless explicitly stated within the code or on this page.

Sheezy.art was written from the ground up by rytoonist. If you'd like to know why, read our mission statement.

Privacy

This website was created by a strong privacy advocate. You may download and/or delete your information from the site at any time by going to your profile settings page.

We do not utilise any advertising or analytics technologies and do not market any aspect of the site or its data as "for sale".

The only personal information we require from you is your email address and date of birth, which are used to prove that you are not a robot and to validate the content ratings that we can serve to you.

When you create an account on sheezy.art, the password you provide is sent to our server over SSL whereupon it is encrypted and hashed for storage. This means that, even in the event of a data breach, your password would be incomprehensible and impossible to decrypt.

In order to implement account banning and artwork view counts, we create a "fingerprint" token based on your current browsing session identifier and/or user agent and store it against your account. We can then compare these tokens with the current session to surmise whether the token is current or not.

We do not store your IP address or browser information.

Though we will do our utmost to prevent it from happening, in the event of a data breach you will be notified via email within 24 hours of the discovery of said breach and our hosting provider will also be notified.

Note that any inactive accounts that do not contain any content will be removed after 120 consecutive days of inactivity. Unverified accounts will be removed after 30 days of inactivity following a series of activation reminder emails.

We will never delete an active user account without warning unless the user account in question contains illegal material.
