# Ratings Guide

Sheezy.Art has **four** tiers for rating content: Everyone (E), Teen (T), Adult (A), and Explicit (X).<br />
'**Content**' is defined as a user's uploaded artworks, description, tags, journals and profile layout information.

The following guide is intended to help users rate their content appropriately, however the Sheezy staff reserve the right to act with moderator discretion if there is content found to be outside the scope of the guide as it is currently written.

As a general rule, if you are unsure if the content you are submitting belongs in one of two tiers, the staff recommends you upload it to the **higher** of the two. While we wish that we could answer every question about every aspect of this guide, we simply do not have the resources to do so. Always use your best judgement, and make sure you tag your content appropriately.

**Everyone**: A family friendly tier- content in this category is unlikely to be triggering. In this tier, content: 

- Does **not** contain partial or full nudity
- Does **not** contain any blood/gore (mild scarring, such as top surgery scars, is permissible, provided it is tagged appropriately)
- Does **not** contain drug use of any kind
- Does **not** contain depictions of and/or references to Teen, Adult, or Explicit content. 
- **May contain** weapons being used as props (not being used with harmful intentions)
- **May contain** depictions of non-detailed anatomy, such as fully developed breasts without exposed or protruding nipples. (i.e. “Barbie Doll” anatomy)

**Teen**: This tier contains content that is still appropriate for minors, but that some users still may not wish to be exposed to.

- **May contain** swearing or inappropriate or "rude" gestures or themes
- **May contain** mild gore (severe scarring as a result of injury, bleeding cuts, candy gore) 
- **May contain** weaponry that is in use or depicted with the intent to harm, cigarette/cigar smoking, the presence of alcohol without explicit consumption, and mild body horror (such as multiple eyes or limbs). 
- **May contain** general horror and trauma themes, provided the content does not meet the requirements in the Adult or Explicit tiers. This includes references to death.
- **May contain** heavily romantic or mildly sexually suggestive themes, such as implied sexual situations and intimate kissing or (non-sexual, romantic) touching.
- **May contain** revealing or minimal clothing, provided the content does not fall under the requirements for the Adult or Explicit tiers.
- **May contain** characters with greatly exaggerated features of the chest (non-detailed fully developed breasts, abdominal muscles, pectoral muscles), provided the features do not meet the requirements for the Adult or Explicit tiers.

**Adult**: This tier is **not** appropriate content for minors, and includes topics and themes that are adult-oriented, but not Explicit in nature.

- **May contain** depictions of partial or full nudity, exposed or prominent nipples on fully developed breasts, or the outline/suggestion of genitalia through clothing.
- **May contain** depictions of active consumption of alcohol and/or hard drugs
- **May contain** highly suggestive sexual content, such as pin-ups or sexual references that do not meet the requirements for the Explicit tier.
- **May contain** depictions of gore and violence such as murder, so long as it does not meet the requirements for the Explicit tier.

**Explicit**: This tier is **not** appropriate for minors, and is reserved for graphic sexual or violent content.

- **All** depictions of sexual arousal, sex toys, or graphic sexual acts belong in this tier.
- **All** depictions of severe gore or violence belong in this tier. This includes, but is not limited to, themes such as graphic loss of limbs, violent death, and realistic depictions of exposed innards. 
- Explicit content of humanized/anthropomorphized animal or monster characters (who are capable of expressing consent and rational thought processes) is allowed. Characters **must be** bipedal (plantigrade or digitigrade) (exception for disabled characters), and **must not** be a literal animal. Explicit content depicting strictly “feral” / quadrupedal animals or creatures is **not allowed**.
- **All** fetishised or overly graphic depictions or implications of bodily waste belong in this tier, including but not limited to soiled garments or diapers where the waste itself is not visible, but implied.

#### Content that is NOT ALLOWED in any fashion or context

- **Any** sexual and/or suggestive content of minors - this includes fictional characters, and “cub” art.
- **Any** explicit work depicting characters or people in a non-consensual context or setting.
- Themes **including, but not limited to**: homophobia, transphobia, racism, ableism, or otherwise hateful speech or content. The staff reserve the right to remove such content under moderator discretion.
- **Any** explicit work depicting strictly “feral” / quadrupedal animals or creatures.
- **Any** live action photos or videos that include a legible human face or any variety of personal or confidential information including but not limited to; vehicle license plates, home address information, email addresses, full names, payment information or private web addresses.
- **Any** artwork generated by AI or ML, or by a 'character builder' service.

### Tagging Policy

Sheezy.Art currently uses a tagging feature that allows users to search for specific content they want to find, and also block tags to avoid being exposed to triggering content or content they just don’t want to see. There is no limit to how many tags you can add to a submission, but all submissions require at least **three** tags.

As such, we ask that the following content always be tagged appropriately with these tags:

- **#eyestrain** - this is content that contains very vibrant colors that may be straining to look at
- **#epilepsywarning** and **#flashwarning** - this is content that contains quick, bright flashes that may induce seizures in some users. 
- Any potentially triggering content such as **#selfharm**, **#spiders**, **#phobia**, etc. If you are questioning whether or not to tag a submission with a particular tag, **it is better and safer to include the tag**.
