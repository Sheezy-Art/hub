# Ratings Guide

Sheezy.Art has **three** tiers for rating content: General (G), Mature
(M), and Explicit (X).

\'Content\' is defined as a user\'s uploaded artwork, description, tags,
journals, and profile layout information.

The following guide is intended to help users rate their content
appropriately. The Sheezy staff reserve the right to act with moderator
discretion if there is content found to be outside the scope of the
guide as it is currently written. This includes the altering of ratings,
tags, post visibility, and the deletion of content that violates our
policies.

As a general rule, if you are unsure if the content you are submitting
belongs in one of two tiers, the staff recommends you upload it to the
**higher** of the two. While we wish that we could answer every question
about every aspect of creative content in this guide, we simply do not
have the resources to do so. Always use your best judgement, and make
sure to refer to our Tagging Policy at the end of this page for required
and recommended content tags.

## General \| *Content suitable for all ages.*

### 1.1 Nudity

**Can contain** non-sexual nudity but **must not** contain genitalia
of any kind. Admissible examples of nudity in this tier include
reference sheets or doll-like anatomy.

-   The #nudity tag is required for all humanoid creatures that are not
    covered in fur, feathers, or other similar obstructions from bare
    flesh.

If the content is suggestive or contains sexual content of any
variety, it will be placed into the Mature or Explicit ratings at a
moderator\'s discretion. Reference our respective \"Suggestive
Content\" policies under each rating for more information.

#### 1.1a Depiction of Nipples

**Can contain** the nipples of all human, humanoid, anthropomorphic,
or otherwise sapient characters that are not presented with the intent
to be sexually provocative. Nipples in this rating **must not** be
meant to elicit a response of--or allude to--arousal in any capacity.

-   All artwork that contains nipples, or implicated nipples (such as
    showing through clothing) **must be tagged** with "#nipples".

-   Belly markings, udders, or nipples on feral animals do not need
    filtering provided that they are not sexual. NOTE: Feral pornography
    is **NOT ALLOWED** on Sheezy in any capacity!

### 1.2 Suggestive Content

**Cannot contain** interaction that depicts, suggests the escalation
to, or otherwise alludes to sexual arousal, gratification, sex acts,
or kink/fetish of any variety.

Content **must not** depict the abuse of recreational substances in
this rating. *Substance abuse* is defined as the overindulgence of a
substance to where a character is inebriated or otherwise compromised
(eg. being drunk or high). Works that contain abuse of these
substances will be rated Mature. Refer to our Tagging Policy below for
required and recommended content tags.

-   Alcohol and Tobacco Products: Users **can** post content containing
    the presence and consumption of alcohol and tobacco products,
    provided that the use of such substances is not abused and does not
    depict inebriation or otherwise compromise the characters consuming
    said substances.

-   Recreational Drug Use: Users **must not** post content depicting the
    use of recreational substances in this rating apart from the
    aforementioned alcohol and tobacco products. All depictions of the
    consumption or presence of recreational substances are to be rated
    Mature.

-   Medicine or Medicinal Drugs: Users **can** post content that depicts
    medicine or medicinal drugs being present and/or used for their
    intended purpose: for the medical treatment of diseases and/or
    health needs. The willful consumption or administration of strong
    medication that results in inebriating side effects is permissible
    when used for medically intended purposes.

Users **must not** post content depicting medicinal drug abuse (review
the above definition of substance abuse).

In summary, users **can** post content that contains the use of
tobacco products as well as alcohol consumption that does not cause
the character to become drunk.

drugs for their intended purposes as health aids. Medical drug abuse
